Alfresco Content Services - Postman collection
==================================================

This **postman** collection has been created for [Alfresco Tech Talk Live #106](https://www.alfresco.com/events/webinars/tech-talk-live-106-intro-alfresco-content-search-services)

Getting started
---------------

These examples have been created for use with the Postman utility. Postman is a testing framework for REST APIs. The tool can be downloaded from [www.getpostman.com](http://www.getpostman.com).

To import the collection, first clone this repository, then open the Postman utility and select the `Import option. Select the `Folder` tab from the dialog and drag and drop the `Alfresco TTL 106.postman_collection.json` file into the target.

*Note* This collection has been created to be run against the Alfresco docker-compose, but an Alfresco repository running at [http://localhost:8080/alfresco](http://localhost:8080/alfresco) would work.
